# GulpularJS


### Work In Progress

This is code taken from a recent project I did for a client. I am cleaning it up
and attempting to make it reusable boilerplate code. Still lots to be done, but
the basics are there.


##### TODO
upgrade gulp to use new patterns and remove use of gulp.run()
see: https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/193
